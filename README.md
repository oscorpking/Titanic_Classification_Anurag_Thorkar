# Titanic_Classification_Anurag_Thorkar


This code segment preprocesses and transforms the Titanic dataset, including handling missing data, feature engineering, correlation analysis, and feature selection, for the purpose of classification.


First, the import statement for _NamedFuncPointer from ctypes is unnecessary and can be removed.

Second, the load_data function reads the train and test data from specific file paths on your local machine. To make the code more reusable, you can modify the function to accept the file paths as parameters or load the data from a different source.

Third, the add_miss_data function fills missing values in the Embarked and Age columns of the train data using some predictions from a random forest regression model. However, this function is not called anywhere in the code, so the missing values in the data are not addressed.

Fourth, there are several functions defined but not used in the code, such as get_combined_data, process_embarked, process_sex, process_name, process_fare, family_size_category, process_family_size, process_age, process_ticket, process_cabin, pclass_fare_category, process_pclass, processs_correlation, and regularization. If you intend to use these functions, you need to call them appropriately.

Lastly, there is no code for training and evaluating the machine learning models. You have imported several models from scikit-learn, but they are not utilized.

If you provide more information about what you want to achieve with the code, I can help you further in implementing the machine learning pipeline for the Titanic classification problem.

The provided code appears to be a part of a project related to the classification of the Titanic dataset. The goal of the project is to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, ticket fare, cabin, etc.

Here is a brief overview of the code:

Importing Libraries: The code starts by importing the necessary libraries for data analysis and machine learning, including numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and various modules from the sklearn library.

Loading Data: The load_data() function is responsible for loading the training and test datasets from CSV files and displaying basic information about the data.

Data Preprocessing: The add_miss_data() function handles missing data in the dataset, filling in missing values for the "Embarked" and "Age" columns using appropriate strategies.

Data Integration: The get_combined_data() function merges the training and test datasets into a single combined dataset for further processing.

Feature Engineering: Several functions are defined to process and transform different features in the dataset:

process_embarked(): Processes the "Embarked" feature by filling missing values, encoding categories, and creating dummy variables.
process_sex(): Encodes the "Sex" feature into numerical values and creates dummy variables.
process_name(): Extracts the title from the "Name" feature, maps similar titles to a common category, encodes the categories, and creates dummy variables.
process_fare(): Handles the "Fare" feature by filling missing values, categorizing the fare values, encoding the categories, and creating dummy variables.
process_family_size(): Computes the family size based on "Parch" (number of parents/children aboard) and "SibSp" (number of siblings/spouses aboard), categorizes the family size, encodes the categories, and creates dummy variables.
process_age(): Handles the missing values in the "Age" feature by training two different models (Gradient Boosting Regressor and Random Forest Regressor) and predicting the missing values based on other features.
process_ticket(): Processes the "Ticket" feature by extracting the ticket letter, encoding the letters, and creating dummy variables.
process_cabin(): Encodes the "Cabin" feature as binary (0 for missing values, 1 for non-missing values).
process_pclass(): Creates a new feature "Pclass_Fare_Category" based on the combination of "Pclass" and "Fare" features, encodes the categories, and creates dummy variables.
regularization(): Performs feature scaling using standardization on selected numerical features.
Correlation Analysis: The processs_correlation() function visualizes the correlation between selected features using a heatmap.

Feature Selection: The get_top_n_features() function utilizes the Random Forest algorithm to determine the top N important features based on their contribution to the classification task.

Overall, the provided code performs data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, correlation analysis, and feature selection as part of a Titanic classification project. However, the code seems incomplete as it does not include the model training and evaluation steps.
